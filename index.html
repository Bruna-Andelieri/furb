            <h1>Welcome to Doggo's Day Care!</h1>
            <p>By 2050, the world’s population may reach a whopping 10 billion and with more people comes more demand
                for – food, fashion, travel, housing and related aspirations. An increasing number of people are unable
                to meet basic needs while two to three billion new urban consumers and youth will receive the majority
                of their information from social media. In a world stretched thin for resources and under the threat of
                global biodiversity loss and climate change, our lifestyles decisions are putting the planet at risk. We
                need targeted action.</p>
            <p>Sustainable living means understanding how our lifestyle choices impact the world around us and finding
                ways for everyone to live better and lighter. Applying a ‘people lens’ to sustainability is new, timely
                and opportunities are great. Sustainable living and lifestyles for the first time appear in the
                Sustainable Development Goals (4 Education and 12.8 Responsible Consumption). UN Environment Programme
                is at the forefront of looking into what sustainable lifestyles are and how decision-making can be
                better harnessed for sustainability. How can governments and business better support and measure change?
